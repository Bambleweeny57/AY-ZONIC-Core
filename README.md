# AY-ZONIC-CORE

**Coming Soon: Rev2.0 of the JONZON-X Platform**

AY-ZONIC-CORE is the next evolution of the JONZON-X-81 hardware seriesâ€”refined, modular, and ready for expansion. This revision standardizes on the **AY-3-8912** sound chip, introduces **back-mounted components**, and adds a **through-hole edge connector** for future interfacing.

### ðŸ”§ What's Coming
- **AY-3-8912-only architecture** for clean PSG register handling
- **Development header** exposing A0â€“A7, 5V, and GND
- **SD card interface experimentation** via Port A
- **Modular layout** for sound card integration and future add-ons

### ðŸ“¦ Repo Goals
- Serve as a reference platform for retro sound and UI development
- Provide onboarding clarity for contributors and hardware hackers
- Document iterative builds, logic quirks, and expansion strategies

Stay tuned for schematics, overlays, and demo routines. Rev2.0 is where legacy meets modular momentum.
